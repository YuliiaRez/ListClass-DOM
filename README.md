# ListClass-DOM
1. Make two inputs: enter a parameter (number) into one, show the volume of the ball with a given parameter in the second. Hang validation on the 1st input.

2. The #elem element is given. Implement 4 functions:
- Add the www class to it.
- Remove the www class from it.
- Check if it has the www class.
- Add the www class to it if it doesn't exist, and remove it if it does.
